You get 1000 for the first human rescued. Then it will progress at 2000, 3000,
4000, then 5000 for every human rescued after that.  This will last the entire
wave or until you get killed.  If you get killed or go to a new wave, then the
progression starts at 1000 again.

You start the game with 3 men and receive and additional man for every 25,000
points you get.



Robotron is hardcoded with 40 unique waves.
After wave 40 the game goes back to the enemy counts from Wave 21. (Wave 41 enemies= Wave 21 enemies)
Wave 21 is the same as wave 41, 61, 81, etc.
Wave 40 is the same as wave 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 220, 240
Wave 55 is the same as wave 35, 75, 95, 115, 135, 155, 175, 195, 215, 235, 255



The waves (or levels) in Robotron 2084 are set up in a definite pattern.  Once
you understand that pattern, you will be better prepared to deal with the
enemies that the game throws at you.  Here is how the waves are set up.

-  The SPHEROIDS make their appearance on the 2nd wave and every wave thereafter.

-  Starting at the 5th wave and every 5 waves thereafter (i.e. 5, 10, 15, 20,
   etc.) is a BRAIN robot wave.  These are also the waves you can amass a large
   amount of points due to all the humans you have to rescue.

-  Starting at the 7th wave and every 5 waves thereafter (i.e. 7, 12, 17, 22,
   etc.) the TANKS will make their appearance.

-  Starting at the 9th wave and every 5 waves thereafter (i.e. 9, 14, 19, 24,
   etc.) you will have one of three alternating enemies to deal with.

   -  On the 9th wave and every 10 waves thereafter (i.e. 9, 19, 29, 39, etc.)
      you will have the "GRUNT" waves.  These waves put you right in the middle
      of a large number of GRUNT robots.  In addition, the lit side edges are
      removed to make the field look bigger.

   -  On the 14th wave and every 20 waves thereafter (i.e. 14, 34, 54, etc.)
      you will have the HULK waves.  These waves put you right in the middle of
      a large number of HULK robots.

   -  On the 24th wave and every 20 waves thereafter (i.e. 24, 44, 64, etc.)
      you will have a combination TANK/ENFORCER wave.  These waves have you in
      the middle of large numbers of SPHEROIDS and QUARKS before they deposit
      their ENFORCER and TANK robots.

-  On wave 28 and each wave thereafter, you will get a combination of SPHEROIDS
   and QUARKS depositing their ENFORCER and TANK robots.  Before this, it was
   only the SPEROIDS depositing their ENFORCER robots to make your life
   miserable.

-  These progressions will continue until you hit wave 255.  After that, the
   waves roll back over to wave 1 and you start the cycle again.
